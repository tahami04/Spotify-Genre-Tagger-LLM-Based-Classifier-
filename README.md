# ðŸ§  Spotify Genre Tagger â€“ Zero-Shot Classification with DistilBERT
This project demonstrates a lightweight zero-shot genre classification system using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library. It classifies music-related text (like lyrics, song summaries, or tags) into Spotify-style genres such as Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, and Latinâ€”without requiring model fine-tuning.

# ðŸ“Œ Features
â€¢	Zero-shot classification using typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli
â€¢	No training required â€” just inference on real lyric samples
â€¢	Classifies into multiple genres based on semantic understanding
â€¢	Includes evaluation via precision, recall, F1-score
â€¢	Visualizes results with a confusion matrix


# ðŸ“Š Results
â€¢	Achieved 100% precision, recall, and F1-score on a 3-sample test
â€¢	Model successfully predicted correct genres for lyric-based prompts


# ðŸ§  Technologies & Dependencies
# Tool/Library	Purpose
transformers	Zero-shot classification pipeline
pandas	DataFrame for lyric & genre data
scikit-learn	Model evaluation (metrics, confusion matrix)
seaborn + matplotlib	Visualization
jupyter	Notebook execution and documentation
